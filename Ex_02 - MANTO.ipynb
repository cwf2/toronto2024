    "# Working with MANTO data\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the goals of DICES is to be interoperable with other Digital Classics projects. In this notebook, we connect to [MANTO](https://www.manto-myth.org/manto), a database of people in Greek and Roman mythology. Many of our DICES characters have records in MANTO, and MANTO provides a lot of potentially useful information about them that's beyond the scope of DICES.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, MANTO gives information about relationships between characters, connections to places in the Greco-Roman world, and primary sources that attest these attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "- the MANTO record for Aphrodite: https://resource.manto.unh.edu/8182231\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that not all of our characters have MANTO records: some of our characters aren't mythological, and in some cases we haven't finished updating our character identifiers to sync with MANTO.\n",
